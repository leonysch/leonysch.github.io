        <h2>About</h2>
                
        <p>Leon YL is a doctorial researcher in the <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies</a> at <a href="https://www.ust.hk/" target="_blank">HKUST</a>. 
		He is advised by <a href="https://panhui.people.ust.hk" target="_blank">Prof. Pan HUI</a> and <a href="https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/xuyan" target="_blank">Prof. Yan XU</a>. 
		He earned his B.Sc. in Electronic Information Engineering from <a href="http://eis.whu.edu.cn" target="_blank"> the Electronic Information School</a> and minor in Marketing Management 
		from <a href="https://ems.whu.edu.cn" target="_blank"> Economics and Management School, Wuhan University</a>.</p>
        <p>Leon's research focuses on constructing theoretical frameworks for the Metaverse, which is envisioned as the evolution of the Internet, with an emphasis on critical issues such as <b>digital identity</b>, 
		<b>interoperability</b>, <b>governance</b>, and <b>legal regulation</b>. As an emerging immersive and interactive digital ecosystem, the Metaverse currently lacks a universally accepted definition and 
		a solid theoretical foundation, highlighting the need for systematic, interdisciplinary research and the development of a shared theoretical consensus.</p>
	 <p>He is dedicated to advancing foundational research in the Metaverse by exploring key challenges, including identity management, interoperability standards, security, privacy, and ethical considerations. 
		 His work aims to provide a robust theoretical foundation and evidence-based policy recommendations to support the sustainable development of next-generation digital ecosystems.</p>
         <p>  <img src="./data/s2s.png" style='width:100%;' border="0" alt="Null" align="bottom"></p>
        <p>His doctoral research focuses on developing an <b>avatar-centric theoretical framework</b> to advance Metaverse governance. His work addresses foundational issues such as <b>identity construction and protection</b>, 
		<b>user interoperability frameworks and development</b>, and the <b>legal implications of virtual indecency</b> within next-generation immersive digital ecosystems. He employs multidisciplinary methodologies, integrating 
		theoretical perspectives from information technology, social sciences, and law, alongside extensive practical experience.</p>
         <p>Before transitioning to academia, he began his professional career at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/" target="_blank">HUAWEI</a>, where he was responsible for managing regional service operations valued at ten million dollars, including network
		 construction and operation services, maintenance, training, and consulting services. He then spent two years working in and contributing to the startup incubation sector, followed by his involvement in a 
		 collaboration between <a href="https://www.cmhk.com/en/" target="_blank">China Merchants Group</a> and <a href="https://eonreality.com" target="_blank">EON Reality</a>. In this role, he led the establishment
		 and operations of <a href="https://eonreality.com/eon-reality-inaugurates-first-interactive-digital-center-china-china-merchants-economic-technological-development-zone/" target="_blank">China’s first Interactive
			 Digital Center and AVR Innovation Academy</a>. Since 2014, he has also served as an external consultant for <a href="https://www.mdpi.com" target="_blank">MDPI AG</a>, a Switzerland-based academic publishing group. 
		 These professional experiences have equipped him with substantial practical expertise, cross-border collaboration skills, and a global perspective.</p>

	Framing metaverse identity: A multidimensional framework for governing digital selves. </a>
	     <br> Liang Yang, Yan Xu, Pan Hui<br>
	      <i style = "font-size: 12px"> Telecommunications Policy（In Press) </i>  
	      <br>The study develops a multidimensional framework for "Metaverse Identity," defining it as a user's 
	      digital self, encompassing personal attributes, data footprints, social roles, and economic elements. 
	      It introduces two guiding principles: <b>"Equivalence and Alignment"</b> and <b>"Fusion and Expansiveness."</b> 
	      The first ensures alignment between Metaverse and real-world identities in norms and standards, protecting rights
	      and establishing conduct codes. The second emphasizes the transformative evolution of Metaverse Identity, 
	      enabling it to transcend real-world limitations, address diverse needs, and promote inclusivity. 
	      Together, these principles balance ethical integration with dynamic co-evolution. <br></p>

	Interoperability of the Metaverse: A Digital Ecosystem Perspective Review.  </a>
	     <br>  Liang Yang, Shi-Ting Ni, Yuyang Wang, Ao Yu, Jyh-An Lee and Pan Hui<br>
	      <i style = "font-size: 12px">IEEE Engineering Management Review.(Under Minor Revision Review) </i>  
	<br>This study employs a systematic literature review to analyze the <b>interoperability challenges</b> within 
	      the Metaverse digital ecosystem. Following <b>Urs Gasser's digital ecosystem interoperability framework</b>, it examines four key dimensions
	      —technological, data, human, and institutional—structured across three layers: <b>infrastructures, platforms, 
	      and virtual-physical integration</b>. By constructing this multidimensional research framework, the study 
	      provides a comprehensive overview of Metaverse interoperability, offering insights to guide future exploration 
	      and address the complexities of this emerging field. <br></p>

		  Legal Implications of Self-presence in the Metaverse. </a>
          <br>Jyh-An Lee*, Liang Yang*, Pan Hui (*Co-first Author)<br> 
          <i style = "font-size: 12px">Media & Arts Law Review, Volume 25, Issue 4.</i>
	  <br>The study examines user <b>self-presence</b> in the context of recent virtual sexual assault incidents 
		in the Metaverse. It traces the technological and social evolution from the traditional Internet to 
		Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and the Metaverse, offering a theoretical framework for 
		qualitative analysis. Drawing on the <b>New Chicago School model</b> by Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig 
		(Code is Law), the research explores regulatory mechanisms of self-presence across four dimensions: 
		<b> technology, norms, market, and law</b>. This framework advances the understanding and governance 
		of digital identities and self-presence in the Metaverse, with significant academic and practical contributions. <br></p>

                 Human-Avatar Interaction in Metaverse: Framework for Full-body Interaction</a>
          <br>Kit-Yung LAM, Yang Liang, Ahmad Alhilal, Lik-Hang LEE, Gareth Tyson and Pan HUI<br> 
          <i style = "font-size: 12px">ACM Multimedia Asia 2022(MM Asia 2022). Tokyo, Japan. </i> 
	    <br>This paper presents a framework for full-body human-avatar interaction in the Metaverse, enabling real-time, 
		accurate motion capture and rendering for shared virtual environments. Using a lightweight Octree data structure, 
		the framework ensures high accuracy with minimal computational and network overheads, making it scalable for large-scale use. </p>
