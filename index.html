    <h2>Leon Yang (Liang Yang)</h2>
                
        <p> Leon Yang (Liang Yang) is a <strong>Technology Governance Scholar</strong> working on next‑generation digital ecosystems shaped by artificial intelligence, immersive technologies (XR), and large‑scale 
		digital infrastructures, with a focus on governance at the intersection of technical systems and institutional arrangements. He is a PhD researcher at the <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies</a> 
		at <a href="https://www.ust.hk/" target="_blank">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>. His doctoral dissertation has been successfully defended, and he is expected to receive his PhD degree in 2026. He is supervised by
		<a href="https://panhui.people.ust.hk" target="_blank">Prof. Pan HUI</a> and <a href="https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/xuyan" target="_blank">Prof. Yan XU</a>. </p>
			
		<p> His research addresses a central question in contemporary technology governance: <strong>how digitally mediated selves are constituted, coordinated, and held accountable as organisational and governance units</strong> across interconnected 
		platforms, infrastructures, and institutions. To this end, he develops an <strong>identity‑centric governance framework</strong> that analytically integrates <strong>identity</strong>, <strong>interoperability</strong>, and <strong>accountability</strong> 
		as mutually constitutive dimensions of next‑generation digital ecosystems.</p>

	<h2>Research Agenda</h2>
                
        <p> <strong>Methodologically, Leon’s research is grounded in conceptual modelling and interdisciplinary theory‑building</strong>, using immersive and AI‑enabled digital ecosystems as analytically rich governance contexts rather than technology‑specific ends. 
		His work contributes to technology governance, digital governance, and AI governance by developing theory‑driven yet institutionally actionable frameworks.</p>
			
		<p> 
		<li> <strong>Identity as a governance anchor.</strong>  </li>
		<li> Leon conceptualises digital identity not merely as authentication or representation, but as a multidimensional governance unit through which <strong>organisational control, risk exposure, and responsibility attribution are mediated</strong>. Drawing on philosophy, 
		law, sociology, and information systems, his work examines how immersive interaction, self‑presence, and embodied multimodal engagement reshape agency and risk. This line of research establishes identity as a normative and analytical starting point for 
		governing avatar‑based harms, data exploitation, and accountability gaps in hybrid physical–digital environments.</li>
		</p>

		<p> 
		<li> <strong>Interoperability as a digital ecosystem challenge.</strong>  </li>
		<li> Moving beyond narrow technical accounts, his work frames interoperability as a problem spanning <strong>infrastructure compatibility, cross‑platform navigation, and physical–virtual integration</strong>, addressing a long‑standing gap between technical standards research 
		and institutional governance analysis. By combining standards studies with governance theory, he examines how fragmented architectures, coordination failures, and regulatory boundaries shape user mobility, identity continuity, and asset portability across platforms.</li>
		</p>

		<p> 
		<li> <strong>Accountability across hybrid systems.</strong>  </li>
		<li> At the governance level, his research develops a structured mapping between <strong>risk, responsibility, and remedy</strong> across technical architectures and infrastructures, social norms, market mechanisms, and legal regulations. This approach provides a coherent analytical 
		foundation for understanding accountability deficits in emerging digital ecosystems and for designing implementable governance tools that operate across platforms, organisations, and jurisdictions.</li>
		</p>

		<p> 
		<li> Together, this research agenda advances a theory‑led understanding of how emerging digital systems are governed, while remaining attentive to institutional feasibility and real‑world governance constraints. </li>
		</p>
