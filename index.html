        <h2>Leon Yang (Liang Yang)</h2>

        <p>
          Leon Yang (Liang Yang) is a <strong>Technology Governance Scholar</strong> working on next‑generation digital ecosystems shaped by artificial intelligence, immersive technologies (XR), and large‑scale digital infrastructures, with a focus on governance at the intersection of technical systems and institutional arrangements.
        </p>

        <p>
          He is a PhD researcher at the
          <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies</a>,
          <a href="https://www.ust.hk/" target="_blank">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>.
          His doctoral dissertation has been <strong>successfully defended</strong>, and he is expected to receive his PhD degree in 2026.
        </p>

        <p>
          His research addresses a central question in contemporary technology governance:
          <strong>how digitally mediated selves are constituted, coordinated, and held accountable as organisational and governance units</strong>
          across interconnected platforms, infrastructures, and institutions.
          To this end, he develops an <strong>identity‑centric governance framework</strong> integrating
          <strong>identity</strong>, <strong>interoperability</strong>, and <strong>accountability</strong>
          as mutually constitutive dimensions of next‑generation digital ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h2>Research Agenda</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Methodologically, Leon’s research is grounded in conceptual modelling and interdisciplinary theory‑building</strong>,
          using immersive and AI‑enabled digital ecosystems as analytically rich governance contexts rather than technology‑specific ends.
          His work contributes to technology governance, digital governance, and AI governance by developing theory‑driven yet institutionally actionable frameworks.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Identity as a governance anchor.</strong>
          Leon conceptualises digital identity not merely as authentication or representation, but as a multidimensional governance unit through which organisational control, risk exposure, and responsibility attribution are mediated.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Interoperability as a digital ecosystem challenge.</strong>
          His work frames interoperability as spanning infrastructure compatibility, cross‑platform navigation, and physical–virtual integration.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Accountability across hybrid systems.</strong>
          His research develops a structured mapping between risk, responsibility, and remedy across technical architectures, social norms, market mechanisms, and legal regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
          Together, this research agenda advances a theory‑led understanding of how emerging digital systems are governed, while remaining attentive to institutional feasibility and real‑world governance constraints.
        </p>

        <h2>Academic Exchange &amp; Service (Selected)</h2>

        <p>
          Leon has engaged in academic research exchange with the
          <a href="https://www.lcfi.ac.uk" target="_blank">Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence</a>,
          University of Cambridge, focusing on AI and metaverse ethics, responsibility, and governance.
          He was a member of an expert discussion group on
          <a href="https://berggruen.org/news/imaginaries-of-immortality-in-the-age-of-ai-china" target="_blank"><em>“The Imaginaries of Immortality in the Age of AI”</em></a>,
          jointly organised by the Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence and the
          <a href="https://www.berggruen.org.cn" target="_blank">Berggruen Institute</a> (Peking University).
        </p>

        <p>
          His academic service includes editorial and publication support for international journals such as
          <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/industries" target="_blank">Industries</a> and
          <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/aieng" target="_blank">AI for Engineering</a>,
          as well as graduate student representation on university‑level postgraduate committees.
        </p>

        <h2>Research‑Informed Practice &amp; Professional Background</h2>

        <p>
          From 2022 to 2024, Leon participated in the design, proposal development, and feasibility argumentation of a laboratory‑led research project on
          <strong>3D virtual scenes and digital humans</strong> at the
          <a href="https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/blog/2022/08/30/mc2-center-for-metaverse-and-computational-creativity/" target="_blank">MC² Lab, HKUST (Guangzhou)</a>,
          approved under the <strong>Guangzhou Nansha District Key Science and Technology R&amp;D Programme</strong> (total funding: <strong>RMB 5 million</strong>).
        </p>

        <p>
          In parallel, he was involved in applied research related to
          <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/news/20220728/hkust-launch-worlds-first-twin-campuses-metaverse" target="_blank"><strong>MetaHKUST</strong></a>,
          a flagship immersive campus initiative of HKUST.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before entering academia, Leon accumulated over a decade of professional experience spanning large‑scale digital infrastructure, cross‑border technology collaboration, and innovation policy implementation.
        </p>

        <p>
          These experiences shaped his sensitivity to how <strong>governance failures emerge from misalignments between technical architectures, organisational incentives, and institutional constraints</strong>.

		digital infrastructures, with a focus on governance at the intersection of technical systems and institutional arrangements. He is a PhD researcher at the <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies</a> 
		at <a href="https://www.ust.hk/" target="_blank">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>. His doctoral dissertation has been successfully defended, and he is expected to receive his PhD degree in 2026. He is supervised by
		<a href="https://panhui.people.ust.hk" target="_blank">Prof. Pan HUI</a> and <a href="https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/xuyan" target="_blank">Prof. Yan XU</a>. </p>
			
		<p> His research addresses a central question in contemporary technology governance: <strong>how digitally mediated selves are constituted, coordinated, and held accountable as organisational and governance units</strong> across interconnected

        <p> <strong>Methodologically, Leon’s research is grounded in conceptual modelling and interdisciplinary theory‑building</strong>, using immersive and AI‑enabled digital ecosystems as analytically rich governance contexts rather than technology‑specific ends. 
		His work contributes to technology governance, digital governance, and AI governance by developing theory‑driven yet institutionally actionable frameworks.</p>
			
		<p> <strong>Identity as a governance anchor.</strong> 
		Leon conceptualises digital identity not merely as authentication or representation, but as a multidimensional governance unit through which <strong>organisational control, risk exposure, and responsibility attribution are mediated</strong>. Drawing on philosophy, 
		law, sociology, and information systems, his work examines how immersive interaction, self‑presence, and embodied multimodal engagement reshape agency and risk. This line of research establishes identity as a normative and analytical starting point for 
		governing avatar‑based harms, data exploitation, and accountability gaps in hybrid physical–digital environments.
		</p>

		<p> <strong>Interoperability as a digital ecosystem challenge.</strong> 
		Moving beyond narrow technical accounts, his work frames interoperability as a problem spanning <strong>infrastructure compatibility, cross‑platform navigation, and physical–virtual integration</strong>, addressing a long‑standing gap between technical standards research 
		and institutional governance analysis. By combining standards studies with governance theory, he examines how fragmented architectures, coordination failures, and regulatory boundaries shape user mobility, identity continuity, and asset portability across platforms.
		</p>

		<p> <strong>Accountability across hybrid systems.</strong>
		At the governance level, his research develops a structured mapping between <strong>risk, responsibility, and remedy</strong> across technical architectures and infrastructures, social norms, market mechanisms, and legal regulations. This approach provides a coherent analytical 
		foundation for understanding accountability deficits in emerging digital ecosystems and for designing implementable governance tools that operate across platforms, organisations, and jurisdictions.
		</p>

		<p> 
		Together, this research agenda advances a theory‑led understanding of how emerging digital systems are governed, while remaining attentive to institutional feasibility and real‑world governance constraints.
		</p>

<h2>Research‑Informed Practice & Professional Background</h2>
        <p> Leon’s academic work is grounded in extensive engagement with applied research, large‑scale digital infrastructure, and government‑funded technology development. From 2022 to 2024, he participated in the design, proposal development, and feasibility argumentation of a laboratory‑led research project on <strong>3D virtual scenes and digital humans</strong>, 
			conducted at the <a href="https://infh.hkust-gz.edu.cn/blog/2022/08/30/mc2-center-for-metaverse-and-computational-creativity/" target="_blank">MC² Lab, HKUST (Guangzhou)</a>. The project was approved under the <strong>Guangzhou Nansha District Key Science and Technology R&amp;D Programme</strong>, with total funding of <strong>RMB 5 million</strong>. 
			In parallel, he was also involved in applied research and experimentation related to <a href="https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/news/20220728/hkust-launch-worlds-first-twin-campuses-metaverse" target="_blank"><strong>MetaHKUST</strong></a>, a flagship immersive campus initiative of HKUST, which explores digital twin campuses, virtual learning environments, and embodied interaction in institutional settings.</p>
		
		<p> Before entering academia, Leon accumulated over a decade of professional experience spanning large‑scale digital infrastructure, cross‑border technology collaboration, and innovation policy implementation. He began his career at Huawei, where he worked on the planning, construction, and operation of ICT infrastructure, including 4G networks and data centres, under diverse regulatory and 
			organisational conditions in China and West Africa. He later co‑founded an innovation‑focused venture under China’s “Mass Entrepreneurship and Innovation” policy agenda and subsequently held senior roles in China–US technology collaboration projects involving XR and digital simulation technologies.</p>
	    
		<p> These experiences shaped his sensitivity to how <strong>governance failures emerge from misalignments between technical architectures, organisational incentives, and institutional constraints</strong>—a concern that runs throughout his academic work and informs his emphasis on system‑aware and implementable governance frameworks.</p>
