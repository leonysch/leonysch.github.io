        <h2>About</h2>
                
        <p>Leon YL is a Ph. D. candidate in the <a href="https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Academy of Interdisciplinary Studies</a> at <a href="https://www.ust.hk/" target="_blank">HKUST</a>. 
		He is advised by <a href="https://panhui.people.ust.hk" target="_blank">Prof. Pan HUI</a> and <a href="https://isom.hkust.edu.hk/faculty-and-staff/directory/xuyan" target="_blank">Prof. Yan XU</a>. 
		He earned his B.Sc. with the <i>First-Class Honour</i> in Electronic Information Engineering from <a href="http://eis.whu.edu.cn" target="_blank"> the Electronic Information School</a> and \
			minor in Marketing Management from <a href="https://ems.whu.edu.cn" target="_blank"> Economics and Management School, Wuhan University</a>.</p>

		<p>His research develops on an <b>avatar-centric theoretical framework</b> to advance Metaverse governance, addressing foundational issues such as <b>digital identity</b>, 
		<b>interoperability</b>, <b>governance</b>, and <b>legal regulation</b>. More broadly, he investigates how immersive technologies and AI reshape human behavior, identity, 
			and society. By integrating perspectives from multiple interdisciplinary such as information technology, law, ethics, management and sociology, his work aims to provide 
			both a <b>theoretical foundation</b> and <b>evidence-based policy recommendations</b> for next-generation digital ecosystems.

         <p>Before academia, Leon gained over a decade of industry experience. He began his professional career at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/" target="_blank">HUAWEI</a>, 
			 where he was responsible for managing regional service operations valued at ten million dollars, including network construction and operation services, maintenance, 
			 training, and consulting services. He then spent two years working in and contributing to the startup incubation sector, followed by his involvement in a collaboration 
			 between <a href="https://www.cmhk.com/en/" target="_blank">China Merchants Group</a> and <a href="https://eonreality.com" target="_blank">EON Reality</a>. In this role, 
			 he led the establishment and operations of <a href="https://eonreality.com/eon-reality-inaugurates-first-interactive-digital-center-china-china-merchants-economic-technological-development-zone/" target="_blank">
				 China’s first Interactive Digital Center and AVR Innovation Academy</a>. He has also served since 2014 as an external consultant for <a href="https://www.mdpi.com" target="_blank">MDPI AG</a>, 
			 a Switzerland-based academic publishing group. These experiences have equipped him with a unique combination of theoretical insight, practical expertise, and a global 
			 perspective—driving his commitment to advancing <b>human-centered and sustainable innovation</b> in AI and the Metaverse.</p>

	Framing metaverse identity: A multidimensional framework for governing digital selves. </a>
	     <br> Liang Yang, Yan Xu, Pan Hui<br>
	      <i style = "font-size: 12px"> Telecommunications Policy, Volume 49, Issue 3. </i>  
		 <br><b>This article has been recognized as the lead article (first article) in this issue<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/telecommunications-policy/vol/49/issue/3" target="_blank"></a>.</b>
	      <br>The study develops a multidimensional framework for <b>"Metaverse Identity,"</b> defining it as a <b>user's 
	      digital self</b>, encompassing personal attributes, data footprints, social roles, and economic elements. 
	      It introduces two guiding principles: <b>"Equivalence and Alignment"</b> and <b>"Fusion and Expansiveness."</b> 
	      The first ensures alignment between Metaverse and real-world identities in norms and standards, protecting rights
	      and establishing conduct codes. The second emphasizes the transformative evolution of Metaverse Identity, 
	      enabling it to transcend real-world limitations, address diverse needs, and promote inclusivity. 
	      Together, these principles balance ethical integration with dynamic co-evolution. <br></p>

	Interoperability of the Metaverse: A Digital Ecosystem Perspective Review.  </a>

	<br>This study employs a systematic literature review to analyze the <b>interoperability challenges</b> within 
	      the Metaverse digital ecosystem. Following <a href="https://dash.harvard.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/7312037d-e20e-6bd4-e053-0100007fdf3b/content" target="_blank"> Urs Gasser's digital ecosystem interoperability framework</a>, 
	      it examines four key dimensions—technological, data, human, and institutional—structured across three layers: <b>infrastructures, platforms, 
	      and virtual-physical integration</b>. By constructing this multidimensional research framework, the study 
	      provides a comprehensive overview of Metaverse interoperability, offering insights to guide future exploration 
	      and address the complexities of this emerging field. <br></p>

		  Legal Implications of Self-presence in the Metaverse. </a>

          <i style = "font-size: 12px">Media & Arts Law Review, Volume 25, Issue 4.</i>
	  <br>The study examines user <b>self-presence</b> in the context of recent virtual sexual assault incidents 
		in the Metaverse. It traces the technological and social evolution from the traditional Internet to 
		Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) and the Metaverse, offering a theoretical framework for 
		qualitative analysis. Drawing on <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4665569" target="_blank"> the New Chicago School</a> 
		model by Harvard Professor <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4665569" target="_blank"> Lawrence Lessig (Code is Law)</a>, 
		the research explores regulatory mechanisms of self-presence across four dimensions: <b> technology, norms, market, and law</b>. 
		This framework advances the understanding and governance of digital identities and self-presence in the Metaverse, with significant academic and practical contributions. <br></p>

          <br>Kit-Yung LAM, Yang Liang, Ahmad Alhilal, Lik-Hang LEE, Gareth Tyson and Pan HUI<br> 
          <i style = "font-size: 12px">ACM Multimedia Asia 2022(MM Asia 2022). Tokyo, Japan. </i> 
	    <br>This paper presents a framework for full-body human-avatar interaction in the Metaverse, enabling real-time, 
		accurate motion capture and rendering for shared virtual environments. Using a lightweight Octree data structure, 
		the framework ensures high accuracy with minimal computational and network overheads, making it scalable for large-scale use. </p>
